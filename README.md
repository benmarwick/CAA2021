The digital ecosystem of a research community is important to understand because it reveals what is possible, what is common, and what unrealised opportunities exist for future work. The recent growth in the use of R in archaeological science is of especial interest because it is a free, open source, and highly extensible programming language that any researcher can contribute to by writing a package and sharing it for others to use. In this presentation we present the results of a study of how archaeologists use R packages, and how archaeologists write them for other researchers to use. We ask: what are the patterns in R package use and production among archaeologists, and what packages are yet to be developed that might satisfy the specific needs of archaeological scientists?
